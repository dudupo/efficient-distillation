Bounds are obtained for characteristic numbers of graphs, such as the size of a maximal (co)clique, the chromatic number, the diameter, and the bandwidth, in terms of the eigenvalues of the standard adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We also deal with inequalities and regularity results concerning the structure of graphs and block designs.}

We prove that there are 3CNF properties that require a linear number of queries, even for adaptive tests. This contrasts with 2CNF properties that are testable with O(√n) queries[7]. Notice that for every bad instance (i.e. an assignment that does not satisfy φ) there is a 3-bit query that witnesses this fact. Nevertheless, finding such a short witness requires a linear number of queries, even for assignments that are very far from satisfying.We provide sufficient conditions for linear properties to be hard to test, and in the course of the proof include a couple of observations which are of independent interest.},

This implies that almost every such a graph is an ϵ(δ)-expander. For Abelian groups this is essentially tight, and explicit constructions can be given in some cases. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

    abstract = { We prove a near optimal round-communication tradeoff for the two-party quantum communication complexity of disjointness. For protocols with \$r\$ rounds, we prove a lower bound of \$\tilde{\Omega}(n/r + r)\$ on the communication required for computing disjointness of input size \$n\$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The previous best lower bound was \$\Omega(n/r^2 + r)\$ due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [Proceedings of FOCS, 2003, pp. 220--229]. Along the way, we develop several tools for quantum information complexity, one of which is a lower bound for quantum information complexity in terms of the generalized discrepancy method. As a corollary, we get that the quantum communication complexity of any Boolean function \$f\$ is at most \$2^{O(QIC(f))}\$, where \$QIC(f)\$ is the prior-free quantum information complexity of \$f\$ (with error \$1/3\$). }

abstract = {We show that every language in NP has a probablistic verifier that checks membership proofs for it using logarithmic number of random bits and by examining a constant number of bits in the proof. If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided “proof” with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive ε such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of Nε is NP-hard.},
