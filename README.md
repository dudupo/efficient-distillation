# efficient-distillation
Collaborative research to achieve (asymptotic) optimal, efficient magic distillation protocol.  This repo is the friendly engaging gate for the [magic project](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/magic.pdf) ([tex file](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/synthesis/magic.tex)) which I have been working on for a while.
I hope to allow others to jump into the business, contribute their help, and collaborate.

## Open problems. 

1. Consider the following [combinatorial problem](https://github.com/dudupo/efficient-distillation/issues/1), which asks how to construct bipartite expander graphs having the property that the size's parity  of the most neighborhoods intersection is even. meaning that if we sample two right vertices $u,v$, then with high probability, they share an even number of neighbors.
