# efficient-distillation
Collaborative research to achieve (asymptotic) optimal, efficient magic distillation protocol.  This repo is the friendly engaging gate for the [magic project](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/magic.pdf) ([tex file](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/synthesis/magic.tex)) which I have been working on for a while.
Currently, I'm on the way to reformating to allow others to jump into the business, contribute their help, and collaborate.
